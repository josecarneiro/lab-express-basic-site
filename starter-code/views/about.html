  <h1>Who was Beethoven ?</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Who was he?</h3>
  <p>Ludwig van Beethoven was a German pianist and composer widely considered to be one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time. His innovative compositions combined vocals and instruments, widening the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto and quartet. He is the crucial transitional figure connecting the Classical and Romantic ages of Western music. </p>
  
  <p>Beethovenâ€™s personal life was marked by a struggle against deafness, and some of his most important works were composed during the last 10 years of his life, when he was quite unable to hear. He died at the age of 56.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Was beethoven deaf?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>At the same time as Beethoven was composing some of his most immortal works, he was struggling to come to terms with a shocking and terrible fact, one that he tried desperately to conceal: He was going deaf. </p>

  <p>By the turn of the 19th century, Beethoven struggled to make out the words spoken to him in conversation.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Legacy</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Beethoven is widely considered one of the greatest, if not the single greatest, composer of all time. Beethoven's body of musical compositions stands with William Shakespeare's plays at the outer limits of human brilliance. </p>

  <p>And the fact Beethoven composed his most beautiful and extraordinary music while deaf is an almost superhuman feat of creative genius, perhaps only paralleled in the history of artistic achievement by John Milton writing Paradise Lost while blind. </p>

  <p>Summing up his life and imminent death during his last days, Beethoven, who was never as eloquent with words as he was with music, borrowed a tagline that concluded many Latin plays at the time. Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est, he said. "Applaud friends, the comedy is over."</p>
