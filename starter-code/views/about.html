    <h2>Sebastiao Salgado</h2>
    <p>
      Salgado was born on February 8, 1944 in Aimorés, in the state of Minas
      Gerais, Brazil. After a somewhat itinerant childhood, Salgado initially
      trained as an economist, earning a master’s degree in economics from the
      University of São Paulo in Brazil.

    <p>
      He began work as an economist for the International Coffee Organization,
      often traveling to Africa on missions for the World Bank, when he first
      started seriously taking photographs. He chose to abandon a career as an
      economist and switched to photography in 1973, working initially on news
      assignments before veering more towards documentary-type work.

      Salgado initially worked with the photo agency Sygma and the Paris-based
      Gamma, but in 1979, he joined the international cooperative of
      photographers Magnum Photos. He left Magnum in 1994 and with his wife
      Lélia Wanick Salgado formed his own agency, Amazonas Images, in Paris, to
      represent his work. He is particularly noted for his social documentary
      photography of workers in less developed nations. They reside in Paris.

      He has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2001. Salgado works on long
      term, self-assigned projects many of which have been published as books:
      The Other Americas, Sahel, Workers, Migrations, and Genesis. The latter
      three are mammoth collections with hundreds of images each from all around
      the world. His most famous pictures are of a gold mine in Brazil called
      Serra Pelada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 2004 and 2011, Salgado worked on Genesis, aiming at the
      presentation of the unblemished faces of nature and humanity. It consists
      of a series of photographs of landscapes and wildlife, as well as of human
      communities that continue to live in accordance with their ancestral
      traditions and cultures. This body of work is conceived as a potential
      path to humanity’s rediscovery of itself in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September and October 2007, Salgado displayed his photographs of coffee
      workers from India, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Brazil at the Brazilian
      Embassy in London. The aim of the project was to raise public awareness of
      the origins of the popular drink. Together, Lélia and Sebastião have
      worked since the 1990s on the restoration of a small part of the Atlantic
      Forest in Brazil. In 1998, they succeeded in turning this land into a
      nature reserve and created the Instituto Terra. The institute is dedicated
      to a mission of reforestation, conservation and environmental education.

      Salgado and his work are the focus of the film The Salt of the Earth
      (2014), directed by Wim Wenders and Salgado's son, Juliano Ribeiro
      Salgado. The film won a special award at Cannes Film Festival and was
      nominated for the best Documentary Feature at the 2015 Academy Awards.
