    <div><p>Albert Einstein grew up in Munich, where his father founded an electrical engineering company. After studying at
            the ETH university in Zurich, Einstein worked at the patent office in Bern, during which time he produced
            several pioneering works in the field of physics. He was later employed at universities in Bern, Zurich, and
            Prague, and from 1914, in Berlin. After the Nazis seized power in Germany, Einstein immigrated to the US, where
            he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Albert Einstein married twice and had
            three children by his first marriage.</p></div>
