    <img src="./images/shigeru_about.jpg" alt=''/>
    <p>Born in Sonobe, Japan, he graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts, 
    he would originally try to have a career in being a manga artist, until eventually being interested
    in video games and, with the help of his father, would join Nintendo in 1977 when he impressed the
    president Hiroshi Yamauchi with his toys. He would then become its first artist and help to create art
    for the arcade game Sheriff, and would later be tasked with creating a new arcade unit for the company.
     This would eventually become Donkey Kong.</p><br />
    <p>He would eventually go on to create both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda which became massive successes for the NES
    and would cement its place in the 80's and help public perception of games. Since then, his games have been 
    flagships of every Nintendo video game console, with his earliest work appearing on arcade machines in the late 1970s. 
    He managed Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development software division, which developed many of the company's 
    first-party titles. As a result of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's death in July 2015, Miyamoto fulfilled the role of 
    acting president alongside Genyo Takeda until being formally appointed as the company's "Creative Fellow" a few months later.</p>
