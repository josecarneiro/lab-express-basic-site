      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        She released her first single, a protest song called "Carcará", in 1965, the same year that
        her brother released his first recording.After releasing "Carcará" Bethânia returned
        from Rio de Janeiro, where she had gone to attend college, to Bahia. This was to only be a
        brief visit, as around that time she was performing at nightclubs and other venues
        throughout Brazil. This song also got her an offer from an RCA Records representative to
        record for the company. However Bethânia continually changed record labels throughout the
        1970s. In 1973 Bethânia released Drama, Luz Da Noite, in which she performed traditional
        Brazilian songs, as well as incorporating literary elements.[12] In 1977 Bethânia went on
        tour and released a gold-certified album, both with the name of Pássaro da Manhã. She
        released Álibi a year later which was also gold-certified with over a million copies
        sold. Around the end of the 1970s, Bethânia became more artistically conservative, moving
        away from the Tropicalismo music her frequent collaborators, including Caetano Veloso and
        Gilberto Gil, had been playing.[11] During the 1980s and '90s Bethânia continued to record
        and perform, with 1993's As Canções Que Você Fez Para Mim becoming the year's most
        successful album in Brazil. In 1976, she released a live album with Doces Bárbaros, a Música
        popular brasileira supergroup. It was recorded June 24 of that year at Anhembi Stadium in
        São Paulo. Its members were Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Maria Bethânia and Gal Costa,
        four of the biggest names in the history of the Music of Brazil. The band was the subject of
        a 1977 documentary directed by Jom Tob Azulay. In 1994, they performed a tribute concert to
        Mangueira school of samba.French filmmaker Georges Gachot completed a documentary film
        "Musica é perfume" about her which was worldwide distributed. In 2008 she recorded an album
        with the Cuban singer Omara Portuondo which was followed by a Live DVD In 2015, her album
        Meus Quintais was nominated for the 16th Latin Grammy Awards in the Best MPB Album

      <h2>Early life and initial artistic activities</h2>
      <p>
        Bethânia is the sixth out of eight children born into the family of José Telles Veloso (Seu
        Zeca), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso (Dona Canô), a
        housewife. The name Maria Bethânia was chosen by her brother Caetano Veloso after the
        homonymous hit song written by composer Capiba and famous at the time in the voice of Nélson
        Gonçalves. Maria Bethania, 1965. National Archives of Brazil. In her childhood, she had
        aspirations to become an actress. However, her mother was a musician, so music was prevalent
        in the Veloso household. Though Bethânia was born in Santo Amaro da Purifição, her family
        moved to Salvador, Bahia when she was 13. The move allowed her to experience the bohemian,
        intellectual circles of the city as well as to visit theaters. When she was 16, her brother
        Caetano Veloso invited her to sing in a film for which he was producing the soundtrack, but
        she refused. Nevertheless, the film's director, Álvaro Guimarães, liked her voice and
        invited the young musician to perform in the 1963 Nélson Rodrigues's musical Boca de Ouro.
        This time Bethânia accepted, and for the first time in her life she went on stage to sing
        for an audience, opening the play performing a samba by Ataulfo Alves.[8] That same year,
        Bethãnia and her sister met singers Gilberto Gil and Gal Costa; Caetano had been invited to
        put on an MPB show to inaugurate the Teatro Vila Velha. The four artists got together and,
        in 1964, staged Nós, por exemplo (We, for example). The show was a success and was
        presented again twenty months later, with the participation of singer-songwriter Tom Zé.
        That same year, the group mounted another show called Nova Bossa Velha e Velha Bossa Nova
        (New Old Bossa and Old New Bossa). Still in that year, directed by Caetano and Gil, Bethânia
        performed another musical, this time on her own, called Mora na Filosofia (Lives in
        Philosophy). She began performing again with her brother, as well as Gilberto Gil, Gal
        Costa, and Tom Zé, at the opening of the Vila Velha Theater in the next year. During one
        of these performances, the bossa nova musician Nara Leão offered her an opportunity to take
        her place in a series of performances titled "Opinião".
