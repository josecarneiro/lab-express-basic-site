# Express basic website

## Introduction

Pick a person that you admire and build a website that shares some basic information about them. They can be a writer, a musician, a celebrity, or someone you know personally.

You should resort to `express` to create your app, build the routing logic with the built-in app routing methods, and serve static content for every request.

6. Build your Express app in `app.js`.
7. Polish your HTML, stylesheets and scripts.

**Your Website should have (at least) 3 pages:**

1. A **Home** page, that welcomes the visitor and links to the other pages on the website.
2. An **About** page, that shares some basic information about the person.
3. A **Works** page, where you showcase some of the work of the person you chose.
3. Bonus: A **Photo Gallery** page, displaying some pictures of the person/their work.


**Your site should also have a `public/` folder for:**

- **CSS** stylesheets
- **Images**
- Bonus: Some **JavaScript** to add basic interactions to the page (click events, fade ins, popups, etc.).

Happy coding! ðŸ’™
