        Albrecht Dürer (21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) is one of the biggest names in German art.
        <br />
        Born in Nuremberg, Dürer would become famous not only for the quality of his works but also
        for the diverse mediums used, from wich his oils, watercoulours and engravings stand out.<br />
        Besides being a pioneering influence in the Northern Renaissance Art scene he was also
        responsible for a number of treatises in mathematics, perspective and proportions. Dürer
        traveled trough Europe, painting for some of the wealthiest merchants and noblest families.
        <br />
        Today his works are spread all across the world and the house he lived in can still be
        visited in Nuremberg.
